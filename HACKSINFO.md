## 🤖 Features with Problems: None!

- Likely a couple (and most that have not been recently updated as part of the fixes), report to Issues and if it is in popular demand then I might try to fix 
## How To Use:

- Simply open the file that sounds more interesting, click the "Raw" button, then copy the code (or just click the copy button) and paste it into the Chrome console when you're on Prodigy.
- Alternitavely, you can try the javascript URL method (putting javascript:thecodehere in the URL box and clicking Enter), if that doesn't work it's likely due to JavaScript not being allowed in Chrome. To allow JavaScript in Google Chrome:
  - At the top right of the Chrome app, click the three dots and choose Settings.
  - In the left sidebar, click Privacy and security, then Site settings.
  - Under Content, select JavaScript.
  - Choose Sites can use JavaScript as the default behavior.
